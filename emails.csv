I'm Brandon, a student in UCSD currently developing a Blackstone Launchpad startup, ""Invi"", to solve vendor communication issues for event planners such as yourself!
We're currently in the process of refining our existing features and developing a deeper understanding of the core issues with vendor communications and we believe that your insight from your experience at Your Day Your Way Wedding Coordinators would be greatly valued!

If you have ever experienced or are currently experiencing issues dealing with:
1. Managing vendor timelines and statuses
2. Keeping track of emails or previous conversations
3. Getting lost in the sauce reading long emails

I believe you would also find great value in ""Invi"". If you are interested, I'd like to schedule a quick 15-30 minute call to get your insights on our current product.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Sincerely,
Brandon Jonathan
Invi co-founder",,,,,
